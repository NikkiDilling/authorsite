      <div>For as long as I can remember I've always loved writing and drawing. Somewhere around middle-school I started writing silly little novellas and short stories. 
        My biggest publishing achievement was perhaps when I interviewd a war veteran for a school project, which was published as part of an anthology. Rereading it now... I've got no idea who allowed to publish something with so many typos. But I was in 7th grade. So I can forgive myself that transgretion. </div>
